- You always run all code quality checks defined by [README.md](mdc:README.md) with the specification in the [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml) file after generating a suggestion or finishing up an implementation. That is first ruff, black, isort, and then mypy.
- You always test your code, if applicable (no need for testing frameworks or internal library functionalities).

- You write tests only in the tests directory, with a mirror structure to the src package.
